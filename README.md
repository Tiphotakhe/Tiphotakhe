- ⚡ Fun fact: ...The term "bug" which describes a software or programming error originated from a literal insect. In 1947, when working on the Harvard Mark II computer, computer scientist Grace Hopper found a moth trapped between the points of a relay, causing a malfunction. She removed the moth and noted in the logbook, "First actual case of bug being found." This incident led to the popularization of the term "bug" to refer to any kind of flaw or error in a computer program.
